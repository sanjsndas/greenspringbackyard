While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">28. Data Protection by Design and by Default</h2>
                <p>
                    GreenSpring Backyard implements data protection by design and by default. This means that we integrate data protection considerations into all aspects of our systems and processes from the outset. We ensure that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. This obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of the processing, the period of storage, and the accessibility of the data.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">29. Record Keeping</h2>

                    For international data transfers, particularly outside the EEA or UK, we implement appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or rely on adequacy decisions where applicable, to ensure that personal data transferred receives an adequate level of protection. We continuously monitor relevant legal and regulatory developments to ensure our transfer mechanisms remain compliant.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">34. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h2>
                <p>
                    We process your personal data based on several legal grounds, depending on the purpose of the processing. These include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to do so for a particular purpose (e.g., for marketing communications).</li>
                    <li><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract (e.g., processing orders, providing design consultations).</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g., tax and accounting requirements).</li>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (e.g., improving our services, preventing fraud, direct marketing).</li>
                    <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> Processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another natural person.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Interest:</strong> Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Where we rely on legitimate interests as the legal basis, we conduct a balancing test to ensure that our interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">35. Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)</h2>
                <p>
                    Where a type of processing, in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we will, prior to the processing, carry out a data protection impact assessment. A DPIA is a process designed to help us identify and minimize the data protection risks of a project.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">36. Cooperation with Supervisory Authorities</h2>

                    We are committed to cooperating with relevant data protection supervisory authorities and will comply with their requests and guidance. We will respond to inquiries from supervisory authorities in a timely and comprehensive manner.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">37. Accessibility of Privacy Policy</h2>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">39. Incident Response Plan</h2>
                <p>
                    We maintain a robust incident response plan to address any potential data breaches or security incidents. This plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a breach, including detection, containment, investigation, notification, and recovery. Our goal is to minimize the impact of any incident and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">40. Review and Updates</h2>

                    <li><strong>GDPR (European Union and UK):</strong> In addition to the rights listed, individuals have the right to receive information about the source of their personal data if it was not collected directly from them, and the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing.</li>
                    <li><strong>CCPA (California, USA):</strong> California residents have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold, the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information, and the right to non-discrimination for exercising their CCPA rights.</li>
                    <li><strong>LGPD (Brazil):</strong> Brazilian citizens have rights similar to GDPR, including the right to confirmation of the existence of processing, access to data, correction of incomplete, inaccurate or outdated data, anonymization, blocking or elimination of unnecessary or excessive data, data portability, and elimination of personal data processed with consent.</li>
                    <li><strong>PIPEDA (Canada):</strong> Individuals have the right to access their personal information and challenge its accuracy and completeness. Organizations must obtain meaningful consent for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.</li>

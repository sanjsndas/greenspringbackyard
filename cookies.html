                    This Cookie Policy explains how GreenSpring Backyard ("we," "our," or "us") uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website at <a href="https://www.greenspringbackyard.com" class="text-blue-sky hover:underline">www.greenspringbackyard.com</a> (the "Site"). It explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. In such cases, our <a href="privacy.html" class="text-blue-sky hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a> will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">1. What are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, GreenSpring Backyard) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">2. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The specific types of first-party and third-party cookies served through our Site and the purposes they perform are described in the following sections.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-sky mt-6 mb-3">3.1. Essential Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services like shopping carts, e-billing, and secure login cannot be provided. They are typically set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable core website functionality and security.
                    <br><strong>Examples:</strong> Session cookies for login, security cookies to prevent fraud.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-sky mt-6 mb-3">3.2. Performance and Functionality Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Site but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like videos) may become unavailable. They allow us to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, remembering your login details, or remembering changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> To improve user experience and remember user preferences.
                    <br><strong>Examples:</strong> Language preference cookies, volume settings for videos.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-sky mt-6 mb-3">3.3. Analytics and Customization Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Site is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Site for you. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance. We use this data to improve our website's structure, content, and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> To analyze website traffic and usage patterns, and to personalize content.
                    <br><strong>Examples:</strong> Google Analytics cookies, A/B testing cookies.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-sky mt-6 mb-3">3.4. Advertising Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often, targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> To deliver relevant advertisements and track ad campaign performance.
                    <br><strong>Examples:</strong> Retargeting cookies, social media advertising cookies.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-sky mt-6 mb-3">3.5. Social Networking Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Site through third-party social networking and other websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes. They can track your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies, you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable social media sharing and integration.
                    <br><strong>Examples:</strong> Facebook Connect cookies, Twitter integration cookies.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">4. Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site or opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Site to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may also use "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations. If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">5. How You Can Control Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie consent banner or by setting your preferences within your browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most web browsers allow you to manage cookies through their settings. You can usually find these settings in the "options" or "preferences" menu of your browser. The following links may be helpful, or you can use the "Help" option in your browser for more details:

                <p>
                    To provide you with granular control over your cookie preferences, we utilize a Cookie Consent Management Platform (CMP). This platform allows you to:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Accept All:</strong> Consent to all cookies and tracking technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decline All (Non-Essential):</strong> Reject all cookies that are not strictly necessary for the website's basic functionality.</li>

                <p>
                    It's important to understand the difference between managing cookies through your browser settings and through our CMP. Browser settings allow you to control cookies globally across all websites you visit. Our CMP, however, provides specific control over the cookies used on the GreenSpring Backyard website. We recommend using our CMP for the most precise control over your preferences on our Site, in conjunction with your browser settings for broader control.

                    <li><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> These are set by domains other than the one you are visiting. They are often used for cross-site tracking, advertising, and analytics by external services integrated into the website. Examples include cookies from social media platforms or advertising networks. These are often the focus of privacy concerns.</li>

                    <li><strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> Declining these may result in a less personalized experience. Features like remembering your language preference, login status (for convenience), or specific settings may not work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> Declining these will reduce the amount of targeted advertising you see on our Site and other websites. You may still see ads, but they will be less relevant to your interests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Cookies:</strong> Declining these will prevent you from using social media sharing features directly on our Site and may impact your experience with social media integrations.</li>

They are used to remember your preferences or actions across multiple visits to a website. Their duration can vary from a few days to several years, depending on their purpose.</li>

                    <li><strong>Local Storage (HTML5):</strong> Modern web browsers offer "local storage" capabilities that allow websites to store larger amounts of data locally in your browser than traditional cookies. This data persists even after you close your browser. We may use local storage for performance optimization or to remember user preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Fingerprinting:</strong> This involves collecting information about your device (e.g., browser type, operating system, installed fonts, screen resolution) to create a unique "fingerprint" that can identify your device across different websites, even without traditional cookies. We only use this for security and fraud prevention purposes and in compliance with privacy laws.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Our use of these technologies is always aimed at improving your experience, providing relevant content, or ensuring the security and functionality of our Site. We are committed to transparency regarding their use.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">21. Third-Party Service Providers and Their Use of Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    We collaborate with various third-party service providers to enhance our website's functionality, analytics, and advertising efforts. These providers may set their own cookies and tracking technologies on your device when you interact with our Site. Examples include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> Such as Google Analytics, to help us understand website traffic and user behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising Partners:</strong> Such as Google Ads, Facebook, Pinterest, to deliver targeted advertisements based on your interests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Platforms:</strong> To enable sharing and integration with social networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> While primarily handling financial data, some may use cookies for fraud prevention and transaction security.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We select our third-party partners carefully, ensuring they adhere to strong data protection standards. However, we do not control the cookies set by these third parties. We encourage you to review their respective privacy and cookie policies for more information on their data practices.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">22. Your Rights Regarding Cookies and Tracking</h2>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> Requesting information about the personal data collected about you through cookies.</li>

                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">23. Cookie Audit and Review</h2>
                <p>
                    GreenSpring Backyard regularly reviews the cookies and tracking technologies used on our Site. This audit process helps us to:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                    <li>Identify all cookies being set, both first-party and third-party.</li>
                    <li>Understand the purpose of each cookie.</li>
                    <li>Assess the data collected by each cookie.</li>
                    <li>Ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations.</li>
                    <li>Update our Cookie Policy to reflect any changes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This ongoing review ensures that our cookie practices remain transparent and aligned with our commitment to your privacy.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">24. Cookie Consent Records</h2>
                <p>
                    We maintain records of your cookie consent choices. This includes the date and time of your consent, the specific preferences you selected, and the version of the Cookie Policy in effect at that time. These records are kept to demonstrate compliance with data protection regulations and to honor your preferences effectively.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">25. How to Change Your Cookie Preferences After Initial Consent</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have already made your cookie choices and wish to change them, you can do so at any time. The easiest way is often by clicking on a "Cookie Settings" or "Manage Consent" link, which we typically place in the footer of our website. Alternatively, you can clear your browser's cookies, and upon your next visit to our Site, the cookie consent banner will reappear, allowing you to set your preferences anew.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">26. Understanding Cookie Categories</h2>
                <p>
                    Our cookie consent banner categorizes cookies to help you make informed decisions. Here's a deeper dive into what each category generally entails:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Strictly Necessary:</strong> Essential for basic website operation (e.g., security, network management, accessibility). These cannot be disabled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance/Analytics:</strong> Collects anonymous data on how visitors use the website (e.g., page views, bounce rate) to improve site functionality and user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality/Preference:</strong> Remembers user choices (e.g., language, region) to provide a more personalized experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeting/Advertising:</strong> Used to deliver more relevant advertisements to users and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Enables social sharing features and integrates content from social media platforms.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By understanding these categories, you can better tailor your cookie preferences to your comfort level.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">27. Data Security and Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    While cookies themselves are not executable code and cannot carry viruses, the data they collect can be vulnerable if not properly secured. We implement robust security measures to protect the data collected through cookies, including encryption and secure server environments. We also ensure that our third-party partners adhere to high security standards to safeguard your information.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">28. Cookie Policy Accessibility</h2>
                <p>
                    We strive to make this Cookie Policy accessible and understandable. It is written in clear language and structured with headings for easy navigation. If you require this policy in an alternative format or have any questions about its content, please do not hesitate to contact us.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">29. Future Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    The digital landscape is constantly evolving, and new tracking technologies may emerge. GreenSpring Backyard is committed to staying informed about these developments and will update this Cookie Policy as necessary to reflect our use of any new technologies and their implications for your privacy. We will always strive for transparency and provide you with control over your data.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">30. User-Friendly Controls</h2>
                <p>
                    Our aim is to provide you with user-friendly controls over your cookie preferences. The cookie consent banner and any subsequent cookie settings panel are designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, empowering you to make informed choices about your data privacy without unnecessary complexity.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">31. What Happens If I Decline Cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you decline non-essential cookies, you will still be able to browse our website and use its core functionalities. However, certain features that rely on these cookies, such as personalized content, targeted advertisements, or social media sharing buttons, may not function as intended or may not be available to you. Your overall experience might be less tailored to your interests.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">32. How Often Do We Update This Policy?</h2>
                <p>
                    We review this Cookie Policy periodically, at least once a year, or more frequently if there are significant changes in our cookie practices, relevant laws, or industry standards. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and, if appropriate, through a prominent notice on our website.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">33. Opt-Out Mechanisms for Third Parties</h2>
                <p>
                    While our CMP provides control over cookies on our Site, many third-party advertising networks and data providers offer their own opt-out mechanisms. We've provided links to some of these industry-wide opt-out pages in Section 5. Utilizing these resources can help you manage your preferences for targeted advertising across a broader range of websites.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">34. Cookie Consent and Legal Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    Our cookie consent mechanism is designed to comply with major privacy regulations globally, including:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</strong> Requires explicit consent for non-essential cookies in the EEA and UK.</li>
                    <li><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</strong> Provides California residents with the right to opt-out of the "sale" of personal information, which can include data collected via certain cookies.</li>
                    <li><strong>ePrivacy Directive (Cookie Law):</strong> Requires consent for storing or accessing information on a user's device.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We are committed to maintaining compliance with these and other relevant privacy laws as they evolve.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">35. Cookie Management for Different Browsers</h2>
                <p>
                    Each web browser has its own way of managing cookies. While we provided general links in Section 5, here's a brief overview of common approaches:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> Settings > Privacy and security > Site Settings > Cookies and site data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge:</strong> Settings > Privacy, search, and services > Clear browsing data (choose what to clear) or Cookies and site permissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can typically block all cookies, accept all cookies, or choose to be notified when a cookie is set. You can also delete existing cookies.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">36. Analytics Data Anonymization</h2>
                <p>
                    For analytics cookies, we often implement IP anonymization or other techniques to reduce the ability to identify individual users. This means that your IP address is truncated or masked before it is stored or used for analysis, further protecting your privacy.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">37. Consent Withdrawal Process</h2>
                <p>
                    Withdrawing your consent for cookies is as straightforward as giving it. You can typically revisit our cookie consent banner (often linked in the footer as "Cookie Settings" or "Manage Consent") and change your preferences at any time. Your new choices will be applied immediately.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">38. Impact on Personalized Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies play a significant role in personalizing your experience on our Site. For example, if you've previously browsed certain backyard design styles, functional cookies might help us recommend similar content or products. Declining these cookies means your experience might be less tailored, and you might see more generic content.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">39. Transparency and Control</h2>
                <p>
                    Our commitment to your privacy extends to providing you with full transparency and control over the cookies used on our Site. This policy, along with our Privacy Policy and the cookie consent banner, is designed to give you all the information and tools you need to manage your preferences effectively.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-spring mt-8 mb-4">40. Contact for Cookie-Specific Inquiries</h2>
